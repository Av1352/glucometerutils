Glucometer Utilities
====================

This utility I created for personal needs, as my glucometer's software
can only print the software (to XPS) without a file export option.

While right now only supports my glucometer (LifeScan OneTouch Ultra
2), I've tried designing it so that it can be extended and used for
other models as well.

Development
-----------

The tool is being written keeping in mind that different glucometers,
even if they are all from the same manufacturer, will use different
protocols.

If you want to contribute code, please note that the target language
is Python 3.2, and that the style to follow is for the most part PEP8
compatible.

License
-------

Due to one of the dependencies being licensed under GPL v3, the
utility is also released under GPLv3 or later.
