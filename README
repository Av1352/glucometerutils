# Glucometer Utilities

This repository includes a command line utility to interact with a number of
blood sugar meters (glucometer) models from various manufacturers.

While support varies by device, the actions that may be available are as
follows:

 * `info` shows the model, serial number, date and time, and configured glucose
   unit of the device.
 * `dump` export the recorded blood sugar or β-ketone readings from the device
   in comma-separated values format.
 * `datetime` reads or updates the date and time of the device clock.
 * `zero` deletes all the recorded readings (only implemented for few devices).

## Supported devices

Please see the following table for the driver for each device that is known and
supported.

† Untested.
‡ Optional dependency on Linux; required on other operating systems.

To identify the supported features for each of the driver, query the `help`
action:

    glucometer.py --driver fslibre help

If you have knowledge of a protocol of a glucometer you would have supported,
please provide a reference, possibly by writing a specification and contribute
it to https://github.com/Flameeyes/glucometer-protocols/.

## Dump format

The `dump` action by default will output CSV-compatible format, with the
following fields:

 * date and time;
 * meter reading value;
 * before/after meal information, if known;
 * comment provided with the reading, if any.

Meal and comment information is provided by the meters supporting the
information. In the future, meal information could be guessed based on the time
of the reading.

The unit format used by the dump by default matches what the meter reports as
its display unit, which might differ from the one used by the meter for internal
representation and wire protocol. You can override the display unit with
`--unit`.

## Development

The tool is being written keeping in mind that different glucometers,
even if they are all from the same manufacturer, will use different
protocols.

If you want to contribute code, please note that the target language
is Python 3.4, and that the style to follow is for the most part PEP8
compatible.
