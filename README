Glucometer Utilities
====================

This utility I created for personal needs, as my glucometer's software
can only print the software (to XPS) without a file export option.

While right now only supports the glucometers I own and for which I have
the specification of the protocol,I've tried designing it so that it can
be extended and used for other models and other brands as well.

Supported devices
-----------------

 * **LifeScan OneTouch Ultra 2**: get information, get and set time,
   dump of readings (including comments and meal specification) in
   native units, memory reset.
 * **LifeScan OneTouch Ultra Easy** (also known as **Ultra Mini**):
   get information, get and set time, dump of readings in native
   units, memory reset.

Dump format
-----------

The `dump` action by default will output CSV-compatible format, with the
following fields:

 * date and time;
 * meter reading value;
 * before/after meal information, if known;
 * comment provided with the reading, if any.

Meal and comment information is provided by the meters supporting the
information. In the future, meal information could be guessed based on the time
of the reading.

The unit format used by the dump by default matches what the meter reports as
its display unit, which might differ from the one used by the meter for internal
representation and wire protocol. You can override the display unit with
`--unit`.

Development
-----------

The tool is being written keeping in mind that different glucometers,
even if they are all from the same manufacturer, will use different
protocols.

If you want to contribute code, please note that the target language
is Python 3.2, and that the style to follow is for the most part PEP8
compatible.
