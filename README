Glucometer Utilities
====================

This utility I created for personal needs, as my glucometer's software
can only print the software (to XPS) without a file export option.

While right now only supports my glucometer (LifeScan OneTouch Ultra
2), I've tried designing it so that it can be extended and used for
other models as well.

Due to one of the dependencies being licensed under GPL v3, the
utility is also released under GPLv3 or later.
